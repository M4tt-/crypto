# crypto

A small library for cryptographic utilities.

## Motivation

This library was written to help complete the CryptoPals exercises, specifically Set 1: Basics.

## Getting Started

Pull the master branch of this repository. `crutil.c` can be linked to in other cryptographic programs.

## About the Architecture

- Header file: `crutil.h`
- Implementation file: `crutil.c`
- Test File: `main.c`

## Supported Utilities

See `crutil.h` for an organized list of functions supporting cryptographic utilities. The categories are:

- Base conversions
- Logical operations for strings
- Number theoretic algorithms
- XOR encryption/decryption
- Basic AES decryption
- General utilities, e.g., transpose, concatenations, etc.
