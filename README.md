# crypto

A small library for cryptographic utilities.

The header file is crutil.h, the implementation file is crutil.c. I've included a test suite as main.c
Functions include base conversions, frequency analysis, XOR cipher 'stuff', useful methods in number theory, and more general, multi-purpose 'programming' style utilities.

I would like to include openSSL compatibility as time permits.
